<p><a href="http://intihuatani.usc.edu/cloud/flowing/">this game</a> is really engaging they don't really tell you what's going on, but the rules become apparent along the way.</p>
<p>The graphics are simple, but very effective and the haunting soundtrack is actually related to the game play. try it, it's very addictive.</p>
