<p class="MsoNormal">Ok, to say that Iâ€™ve been sparse with details on what Iâ€™ve been up to would be an understatement, so Iâ€™m going to try and fix that.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Iâ€™ve been gone just over 2 weeks, and Iâ€™m trying hard to go native, so I have my thongs, my short-blacks and flat-whites, and Iâ€™m getting there with saying chips when I mean crisps.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So starting back in London, it seems that no matter how well prepared I think I am, I always have to stay up all night before I go somewhere finishing off last minute things. So when the cab came at 7 Iâ€™d caught 45 minutes of semi-sleep, and was feeling a bit trampish. The only shower was in the travelex <span lang="EN-GB">business centre, so i grabbed a massive handful of complementary sweets and spent 20 minutes luxuriating in a quite dodgy shower. One of the better uses of Â£14 I can think of!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The flight was cool, I stole the blanket and it makes a very nice scarf. I watched 3 films and spent a long time staring at how much nothing there is just before Las Vegas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In LA I stayed with Joshâ€™s parents, who are very cool. They gave me a little self contained room, and the most amazing sweet grapefruits.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/250px-Pomelos_-_Grapefruits.jpg" height="333" width="250" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the first day I was spotted as the weird guy looking for the sunny spot outside a cafe (while all the native LA people were looking for spots near the patio heaters) by a girl (Meaghan) who turns out did the same exchange as Iâ€™m doing, except she was at sciarc and was at <span style="font-variant: small-caps">rmit</span> 3 years ago. Quite the coincidence!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/n541400612_2088343_9652.jpg" height="453" width="604" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">LA is not a city that is really geared towards people who donâ€™t drive. But I walked anyway, and probably covered about 10 or 15 miles a day taking in a lot of designer places and that sort of stuff. On the second day I decided to go to the beach, but forgot to get off the bus and ended up half way to Malibu near a â€˜parkâ€™ (some wilderness with paths) so I went for a bit of a jaunt into the hills and then walked to Santa Monica beach (which is further than it looks on a map).<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/n541400612_2088411_2371.jpg" height="108" width="604" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <span lang="EN-GB">Where I started the beach bike path was empty, and as I got closer and closer to Venice it got busier and more packed with people posturing in their sparkly â€˜correctâ€™ sports kit. The funny thing is that most people really didnâ€™t know what they were doing, 4k road bikes with beach cruiser setups, people on skates falling forwards at about the same speed as they were moving, challenging physics and just about staying up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/n541400612_2088355_2517.jpg" height="453" width="604" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As I got to Santa Monica, I heard someone yell â€˜Benâ€™, it took a while to register seeing as I was in a city where nobody knew my name, but it turned out to be Meaghan, (so we are stacking up the odds pretty high here). She was with the same guy that sheâ€™d been with at lunch the day before, so we all went for dinner at a place called the library ale house (fine beer and tasty nosh, all in a nice place by some sciarc dude).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Iâ€™m struggling with the ability to give off the â€˜Iâ€™m single, come and chat me upâ€™ vibe to women in quite the same way that I do to men, a dude in the Diesel shop spent a long time showing me jeans that I couldnâ€™t afford, and Iâ€™m pretty sure he knew that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Anyway, I met up with Stephanie Gary, the bike patrolâ€™s American envoy (due to the special Gary clause), and she drove me around LA a bit (it makes more sense in a car) and then we went to the beach to see the nutters roller dancing, doing henna tattoos and smoking â€˜medicinalâ€™ marijuana. Then as we walked along the only street in LA that it felt normal to be walking on (Abbot Kinney, very nice) Meaghan stuck her head out of her car window and said hello, if youâ€™d bet on this on an accumulator at your local tote youâ€™d be turning a pound into at least a million.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I went to the Gehry office on the last day to speak to the GT people about geeky stuff and do some sort of 18<sup>th</sup> century introduction thing. Very interesting stuff, and it looks like a nice place to work on the main gehry shop floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">American airports are crap.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center" align="center"><span lang="EN-GB"><br />
<hr align="center" size="2" width="100%" />  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">So, finally in Melbourne, itâ€™s lovely here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The weather is great, sunny, but not too hot (for me, but I like it hot, so maybe Iâ€™m a bad judge)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Iâ€™ve been visiting cafes as a way of forcing myself to visit different neighbourhoods, and the baseline standard of coffee here is so good, the worst coffee Iâ€™ve had here is better than youâ€™d get in most cafes in the UK, and the best is just superb the only place in the UK that comes close is flat white.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">the best so far is <a href="http://stali.com.au/blog/">st ali roasters</a>, and i'm going for a public cupping session tomorrow at lunch time, woooo!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/cupping-765352.jpg" height="400" width="266" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Iâ€™m working in a practice, and as far as practice work goes, itâ€™s pretty good, but Iâ€™m on the verge of making a proper career decision that Iâ€™m not really interested in architecture as it is practiced in the real world. I love teaching, researching new working methods and thinking about big ideas, but I donâ€™t think I have the patience to be a straight practitioner. This is going to take a bit more thought as to how it pans out in the long term, and whether itâ€™s just me being adverse to real work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Being the geek I am, Iâ€™ve got into the dorkbot scene here, and they all seem really nice, and very welcoming. Yesterday was an amazing presentation by <a href="http://www.monolake.de/">Robert henke</a> who does super cool live performance techno.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Andâ€¦ Iâ€™ve bought a bike, itâ€™s yellow, and itâ€™s a â€˜properâ€™ track bike (but I put a brake on, cos Iâ€™m a wimp). Iâ€™m not in the shape I thought I was in. I did about 8-10 laps of the <a href="http://www.brunswickcyclingclub.com">velodrome</a> and nearly puked. The banking is so much steeper than Iâ€™d imagined it would be, I was struggling to keep the bike on the track in the bends. this challenge with CT is going to be an interesting race</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Anyway, I need to post this, and Iâ€™ll link to it on FB.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">More soon, promise, honest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Kisses <o:p></o:p></span></p>
