<p>This post is long and a bit pretentious. Think of it as therapy for me rather than something you should read[1. you could probably apply this disclaimer to everything I write!].<!--more--></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last time I was in New York, <a href="https://twitter.com/mcfblair">Matthew</a> and I were on the High Line, strolling about and shooting the breeze. We ended up talking about books, and how the things you read are a factor in shaping who you were now. I wrote “<em>What is my canon?</em>“, on my to-do-list that afternoon. I have been dragging that question around like a millstone ever since. For some reason, I haven’t been shaping it in my subconscious like I usually do. It has been like a glass marble with a question in it; I can look at it, but not touch.</p>
<p>Unanswered questions normally serve as filing cabinets that I store snippets in. Until I feel like there is enough raw material for a fully formed thought snippets keep piling up. Impenetrable idea-anchors often fade away without any fanfare but this one has stuck[1. I initially wrote this on holiday, this bit said: The latest trigger resurrecting this question is, 1) this new notebook, and 2) that I’m reading “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” (ZAMM from now on, it’s a bit of a mouthful). I get the feeling from the way people speak about it that people-like-me should read “ZAMM”. That it should be pivotal in their lives. In fact, I have probably come through it rather late in my life. I get the feeling that it would be life altering if you were to read it in your teens.].</p>
<p>I find myself wedged uncomfortably between architecture people and technology people. I’m not really one of either.</p>
<p>This leads me to have enormous past tense FOMO. The sense that I should have read lots of books. The Architect is a little ashamed. I have never read anything by the Modernist Masters, or for that matter, much of architectural theory outside the millennial cusp stuff, by Greg Lynn, Hani Rashid and chums.</p>
<p>The technology person in me hides behind an even more extreme fig leaf. I don’t have the obligatory grounding in Tolkien and Asimov. Except accept for reading The Hobbit in primary school, I haven't read <em>any</em> Tolkien[1. I'm stereotyping technology people as such terrible nerds. I read a few pages of Silmarillion in primary school, but I was totally defeated by it.]. The list of things I have not read, and feel that I should, could last pages[1. although I have read The Mythical Man Month, so I feel like everything should be forgiven.]. Not to mention the things that are unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>That said, I have read a lot of other things. Most of it has had some part in shaping who I am, and the initial question was not, <em>what is not my canon</em>. I could probably break my life into two parts from a canon perspective.</p>
<p>Number one, from birth until the beginning of my third year at uni. I read a review of the non-standard architectures exhibition at the Pompidou Centre. [1. Until that point I wanted to do the psychology of how bars worked!]. I went to the exhibition, wrote my dissertation about the subject. The rest was history. I am not really sure what was going on in this section; there wasn't a direction. There <em>was</em> a lot of magazine reading[1. I had every edition of Wallpaper* until issue 100]. There was lots of reading Robinson Crusoe and Enid Blyton under the covers with a torch while I was a kid.</p>
<p>Number two is from then until now. We can split that in half as well.</p>
<p>Section A, is computers, geometry, shade making etc. The stuff I read to write my <a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/?p=1928">undergrad dissertation</a> and do my <a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/?p=2293">masters</a>.</p>
<p>Section B, is still happening. It started while I was doing my diploma. I was close to Oxford Uni, the <a href="http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/">Future of Humanity Institute</a>, <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/">James Martin School</a>, etc. Going to the lectures and seminars that came with that meant that I was getting to see all kinds of strange ideas.</p>
<p>Up to the end of A I was a firm believer in the tractability of problems. If you just threw enough computing resources at them they would submit. Then slowly I realised that was not only false, but almost always false. That put me into the right frame of mind to be fascinated by the wicked problems the FHI was into.</p>
<p>I wanted to know how the future would play out. I was convinced that my <a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/?p=2061">major study</a> was going to be about future prediction techniques. It didn't end up going that way, but the evolution into the study of over-confidence was an important thing. Not the end points, but the journey.</p>
<p>Through exposure to new ideas during the last year of my diploma I changed how I looked at the world a lot. I discovered that being a contrarian wasn't a bad thing, that rationality could be practical. Maybe most importantly, that biases were ever present. These were revelations. A combination of reading, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/">Overcoming Bias</a>, <a href="http://www.philosophybites.com/">philosophy bites</a>, <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/">Econtalk</a>, and a keystone of Erika’s recommendation of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1780660251/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1780660251&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notioparal-20&amp;linkId=V43JELE34LWYQHBR">Irrationality</a>. All these things had a big influence on me, mainly because they were introducing me to new ideas.</p>
<p>Imagine the effect, that learning how dysfunctional brains are, had on a version on me that had spent the previous two years reading Alice in Wonderland, Flatland other geometry rooted ideas! Logic existed in the abstract, but it was not a native thought start. Hanson and <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/">Boston</a> have had a huge effect on how I think. The <a href="http://www.global-catastrophic-risks.com/">Global Catastrophic Risks Conference</a> lead to my running my <a title="I think most of the links here are broken now." href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/?p=593">Beginners Guide to the Apocalypse Studios at UTS</a>. [1. even though I think that the only place that a studio like Beginner's guide to the Apocalypse will ever be successful is Oxford Brooks, nowhere else, promotes <em>thinking </em>as strongly.]</p>
<p>My career at BVN has followed a similar trajectory. I started off working with shapes; rational stuff like solar driven geometry. Analysing how facades would work, making bits of ASB work.</p>

<p>Then it shifted and I've ended up making internal products and finding ways to get people talking and having ideas. Things like a <a href="https://github.com/notionparallax/ShadowWolf">system to capture all the data we were missing about projects</a>, or a <a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/?p=1762">twitter thing to find</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23architecture%20%23bigquestions&amp;src=typd">#architecture's #bigquestions</a>.</p>
<p>Some time in my third year I became a huge <a href="http://www.amazon.com/William-Gibson/e/B000AP5DM0/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1447453327&amp;sr=8-2-ent">William Gibson</a> fan, then once I'd finished everything he'd written I started on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Neal-Stephenson/e/B000APS8L8/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1447453361&amp;sr=8-2-ent">Neal Stephenson</a>. I've now read everything Stephenson wrote--I feel like his books leave me feeling smarter and knowing more than I started with. I've also recently become a fan of <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/">Hardcore History</a>.</p>
<p>I've also been tracking the articles I read for a little while now via <a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/?p=1679">Pocket and IFTTT</a>.</p>
