There's been a pretty good discussion on the BVN Slack channel, _#future-of-work_ about robot overlords and when they are coming to take our jobs.

There was fair bit of discussion that's been of the sort where we can't seem to agree on basic premises. Once we got that sorted out things all seemed to flow quite nicely. I thought I'd write down some of those premises so that new people to the discussion can catch up quickly. Also to sort them out in my own mind.

The first thing that I found helpful was that there is going to be a time period that the future is going to unfold over. This seems to be a trivially obvious thing to say, but it seemed like the key to making everyone agree.

## State of nature
This refers to the pre-Talorian period, maybe even to a pre-Adam Smith period, where people just made what they needed. Maybe they went to someone else and bought a thing from them but that thing had been made from scratch by that person.

## Industrial
In this period pin makers are breaking up their tasks, steam mills are making weavers much faster and production lines are banging out Model T Fords at a rate of knots. Technology is starting to put people out of work. That technology could be a machine (steam mills), the application of an idea (specialisation), or the combination of the two (production lines). In this period human manual labour is being replaced by the brute force of machines. Because we needed fewer hands to carry and bash things people were freed up to do other things, like become travel agents or to sell cars.

## Information
This is the period that we're coming to the end of at the moment. In the industrial period the machines amplified our physical capacity by doing the grunt work. They didn't do any _crafting_ they were replicators. People did all the thinking. In the information period people still do the thinking, but the grunt work is done by machines. E.g. people put information in once, and then it gets fed to different places. In the industrial era that would have meant filling in forms in triplicate etc.

This has led to the travel agents having a tough time. This isn't because the computers are doing anything special, they are just better at searching a lot of databases very quickly. There is a bit of a lessening of the service provided by a good, human travel agent because they can't anticipate what you want, or offer useful alternatives. However, computer systems are cheaper than people. We book through a computerised system because we value the extra cash in our wallets over the better service offered by a person.

## Species changeover
_This is a controversial name, so if anyone has a better one I'm all ears._ The increasing ability of computers to do things that are _unique to human abilities_ has been underlined recently with the defeat of a Go master by a computer. This seems to suggest that we're coming out of the AI winter. This is _not_ the part of human history where we are replaced by Skynet! This is the transition period. It's just starting in a serious way, and it's going to be a really interesting time to be alive[^1].

This is the bit I'm going to spend the most time writing about because the [next period looks pretty grim](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-age-of-em-9780198754626)[^2]. 

While we navigate this period (of unknown and probably unknowable length) there will be a few important things to think about.

1. Humans have money. At the moment no machines have agency (that we know of). Even the high frequency trading bots are explicitly doing the bidding of a human somewhere.
2. Humans care about 'irrational' things. We care about the story that a barista tells us about a coffee ("oh, I can really taste the life story of the grower" vs "ooh, this is black and hot"). Some of these things can be made to seem rational by casting them as signalling, but we certainly don't think of them that way. Because of this humans care about doing things that aren't well aligned with computer's wants.
3. Humans are good at human things, computer are good at computer things. That is a well understood distinction, but recently the line between the two has been moving over towards the computer. Computers can now recognise and describe objects in images, they can drive cars, they can win at Go. They are pretty terrible at opening doors and having goals of their own.
4. OK, that's the good things out of the way. Thing four is more or less thing three, but with a pessimistic slant on it. The things that you value as your key, human, irreplaceable traits are probably next on the list for AI to conquer. Things like coordination and negotiation are pretty human skills, but they are only really needed in situations with incomplete data. For example, in a construction context, architects talking to builders is largely to discuss things that were missing or unclear on the documents. This isn't a bad thing now because there are gains to be made in intuition. In the future I'd imagine that the documentation will me more complete, and will contain conditional information[^3]. We like to think that our key value is our ability to think, but actually, our ability to work in confined spaces might be just as important[^4]!
5. Most of what you do with your life is _not_ high value. I feel like I'm a smart valuable person. You probably do too. However I generate most of my value to an endeavour in _very_ short bursts. It could be 10 minutes of work that turn into a month's worth of my output. Some people are able to have higher outputs, but they are probably also assisted substantially by a support structure. Most of my life is spent getting ready for the next burst (reading, resting, doing important, but low value tasks). Hold that in your mind for a second.
Part two of this is that it's very unlikely that a machine will "take your job" in the sense that they will replace you 100%. What is far more likely is that the machine will erode your usefulness. If you are a _thing-doer_ and your company employs 100 _thing-doers_, then it usually won't be a situation where they call you all into a meeting and say "someone has automated your jobs away, goodbye". Your job will become a bit more efficient, then when Bob retires and Mavis moves to Manitoba they won't be replaced. Then 98 of you will do 100 people's work and it won't be a stretch.
Putting these two together, what this will mean is that the effect that has hollowed out the demand for village musicians will do the same for most knowledge workers[^5]. The work will be hollowed out of all the bullshit that can be automated, and therefore will require fewer people to do it. I've already talked about [delegation](http://notionparallax.co.uk/2015/delegation-programming) and this will be another example of delegation to a non-human agent. The amount that this is possible will vary by occupation, so to get a good idea of how hard _yours_ will be take an inventory of your week using [Rescue Time](http://notionparallax.co.uk/2016/connecting-rescue-time-to-habitica-how-to-reward-yourself-for-doing-useful-things-without-using-up-all-your-brain-power) or something to give you an accurate picture of what you actually do. Then decide if you are the _only_ person who could do it. The percentage of stuff that _only you_ can do is probably the percentage of people who will be left.
6. I'll leave this list on an optimistic note. All of the above doom-mongering is based on a simple (and wrong) assumption that there will be no new jobs created. There will be growth in sectors that are currently small, and whole new sectors created. To take the shine off the enthusiasm, there's no guarantee that new job creation will continue to outpace deconstruction. This might be the time that things get out of hand!

The question for this period are how best to navigate it so that you hang onto the mechanical bull of the high life for as long as possible. Eventually it'll be about owning capital; especially land or raw materials[^6]. In the transition it will be different. I can only guess at how, but I'd say that it's about meta-skills. Can you be really charming? Can you learn new things really fast? Can you predict where things are going and position yourself to catch the wave rather than get pounded into the sand by it?

## Homo-redundant
By this point AI has surpassed all of humanities capabilities and is now the dominant species on the planet. There are a bunch of different ways this could go down. For a fairly gentle explanation, [_wait but why_ is excellent](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) and for a really kick ass explanation, go straight to the source with [Nick Bostrom's book](http://amzn.to/1SaxhmF).

# Should I be really pessimistic?

I don't think so! I think that the way to go is to be an informed optimist. There might well be a change over period longer than all of our lifespans, so going off grid right now would most likely be foolish. 

Working on your meta skills, and finding pockets of new types of work will keep you ahead of the automation. Learning to work _with_ computers and robots will make you safer too. I'd suggest inviting them into your life to free you up to do other things, things that you are more uniquely suited to as a human.

[^1]: Probably in the proverbial way. There's going to be a lot of upheaval and nobody really knows how to get through it.

[^2]: [This is a link to 'Age of Em'](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-age-of-em-9780198754626)] that's where we're all simulated people living simulated lives. A lot like the Matrix, but without the power supply issues that require whole human bodies. It's pretty cheerful compared to possible futures like Terminator!

[^3]: E.g. if the price of _x_ goes up by more than 10% before you get to this part of the project then replace it with _y_ or _z_, whichever is cheaper. This wouldn't be possible in the current business model, but would be in a pattern based system much more analogous to software libraries.

[^4]: In the paper that I wrote [this post about (_Architects getting automated?_)](http://notionparallax.co.uk/2015/architects-getting-automated) back in July last year, the model weighted several different skill types needed to do a job. Turns out that working in confined spaces is one of the things that makes a job very difficult to automate. That assumption hinges on robotics technology staying based on rigid bones with joints. If it goes down a different route then things might change radically.

[^5]: With recorded music nobody needs to go to the pub to hear Uncle Albert play the piano, they can stick on a CD or listen to Spotify. This means that only the _very best_ musicians can make a living this way.

[^6]: To sell to the machines, assuming that they don't just come and take it.
