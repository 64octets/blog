<p>Suddenly it is normal to get site photography from a drone at the start of an architectural project. As buildings get designed they get montaged into site photos. Traditionally those photos were from ground level. Now that has changed, the the designer is continually reminded of the roof[1. It also means that the building will be photographed from above much more often during its life. Especially as more people get drones and those drones get more capable.].<!--more--></p>

<p>There's always been a lot of interest in facades, especially since computers made getting fancy accessible to the masses. Since roofs stopped being highly visible (think cathedrals etc.) the roof has been a bit of an afterthought. There have been some notable exceptions, but usually it's just a place to shove unwanted air-con equipment.</p>
<p>This post isn't supposed to be anything more than a quick observation. Keep an eye out for people paying more attention to roofscapes, I bet it's because of drone photography.</p>
