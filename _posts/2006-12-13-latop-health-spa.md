<p>My laptop is going to a healthspa for a week or two, so i'll have to fire up my desktop for the firt time since i decided i hated visa.</p>
<p>Itâ€™ll be interesting to see if itâ€™s faster than the laptop, twin single core opterons and 1gb of ram (soon to be 4) vs a centrino duo with 2gb it should be close, but I have a feeling that the desktop will win. Itâ€™s not very hippy friendly though, itâ€™s the equivalent of me having 51 energy saving light bulbs turned on in my house whenever itâ€™s running.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m going to be an uber -geek and have a play with blender, but I canâ€™t quite bring myself to use it on windows, so Iâ€™m going to take the opportunity to install linux as a dual boot.</p>
<p>Right Iâ€™m off down the shops to buy some nhs specs with a plaster on the bridge of the nose</p>
