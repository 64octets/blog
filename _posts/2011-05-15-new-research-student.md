<p><a title="Jay Patel's site" href="http://www.the10thletter.info/"><a href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jay_ear.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-704" title="jay_ear" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/jay_ear.png" alt="" width="50" height="183" /></a>Jay</a> is a final year student at UNSW doing <a href="http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/futurestudents/Undergrad/BArchComp/">architectural computing</a>. He is interested in using the Microsoft Kinekt as a part of the architectural workflow, BVN, and by proxy I, will be the 'client' on this project so I'm excited to see what he comes up with. There is already a huge background in UI for design, so he is currently doing a lit review of that work. He's posting his reviews of papers and other useful sources <a href="http://10thletterresearch.blogspot.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p>With Flora's <a title="The ubimash site" href="http://ubimash.com/">ubimash</a> work there is already a substantial technical basis for this work so there is a great possibility to do some really interesting user-focused work.</p>
