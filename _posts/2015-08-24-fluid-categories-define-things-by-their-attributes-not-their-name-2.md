<blockquote><p>Categories[1. I recognise that I don't know any Category Theory and not a great deal of Set Theory. I might be committing horrible sins with this statement. It works in it's naive context though.] are an emergent way of describing set creation operations based on attributes</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of what I want to say here is taken directly from an old post on the BVN internal blog that I called <em>Taxonomy.</em> I'll summarize it here and copy that post below so that you don't need to go looking.</p>

<p>In the video above Richard Feynman[1. one of my heroes. If he isn't one of yours then he really should be!] tells a story about naming things. He separates the <em>name</em> of something from what that thing <em>is</em>[1. I think that this is the way ]. This is a safe and future proof way of thinking about categories. Directly categorising things is lazy thinking and asking for trouble!</p>

<p>I made this presentation to explain how data is organised these days.</p>
<p>It's part of the work on the People and Projects data cleaning, so I'll refer to that throughout. It's applicable to a lot of other things though so keep an open mind and it might be interesting.</p>

Methods of filing, organisation, classification, have taken up thousands of hours of discussion. There's even a whole job title and academic discipline associated with taxonomy. Departments of library science etc.</p>
<p>There is a problem with old fashioned filing of physical items though:</p>

<p>Almost everything we work with is <a href="http://philosophybites.com/2007/08/timothy-william.html">vague</a> in one way or another. Consider organising these shapes:</p>

<p>How do we know if she's a witch? She's either a witch or not a witch right?</p>

<p>Luckily a new method of filing has emerged. By adding metadata to things[1. yes the same metadata that all the fuss is about in the news] we are able to filter things out of a giant pile really quickly.<img class="alignnone wp-image-18182 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pile.gif" alt="pile" width="800" height="450" /></p>
<p>The computer is able to make a big sieve that only lets through things that have certain <strong>attributes</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/taxonomy_Page_11.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-18186 size-full" title="This is a small dolphin.

<p>A person can have attributes, a project can too. The big questions of our time are about what that means, and what we can do with that knowledge!</p>
<p>What's really cool is that you can stack these sieves so that you can combine the filters. <a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/taxonomy_Page_14.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18187" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/taxonomy_Page_14.png" alt="taxonomy_Page_14" width="5334" height="3000" /></a> <a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/taxonomy_Page_15.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18188" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/taxonomy_Page_15.png" alt="taxonomy_Page_15" width="5334" height="3000" /></a></p>

As a major nerd, set theory is my favourite type of maths. One of the main set theory text books is called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Sets-Fundamentals-Contemporary-Undergraduate/dp/0387940944/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425016322&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Joy+of+sets">The Joy of sets</a>". As Stella about it; she loves it too.</p>
<p><a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/taxonomy_Page_16.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18189" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/taxonomy_Page_16.png" alt="taxonomy_Page_16" width="2107" height="1185" /></a></p>
<p>With a bit of set theory we can do all these cool things and represent them with Venn diagrams.<a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/taxonomy_Page_17.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18190" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/taxonomy_Page_17.png" alt="taxonomy_Page_17" width="2400" height="1350" /></a></p>
<p>Eventually getting really complicated</p>
<p><a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/taxonomy_Page_18.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18191" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/taxonomy_Page_18.png" alt="taxonomy_Page_18" width="3067" height="1725" /></a></p>
<h2>That's cool, but why?</h2>
<p>You will have seen this kind of thing used a lot in online shopping. You want <em>shoes</em>, in <em>your size</em>, in <em>black</em>... coming up!</p>
<p><a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/taxonomy_Page_19.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18192" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/taxonomy_Page_19.png" alt="taxonomy_Page_19" width="3414" height="1920" /></a></p>
<p>But this is only one facet of things. Internally Mr Porter is tracking a whole lot more stuff. There is loads of metadata but they make a call about what to expose to the public.</p>
<p><a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/taxonomy_Page_20.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18193" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/taxonomy_Page_20.png" alt="taxonomy_Page_20" width="5334" height="3000" /></a></p>
<p>It's a curatorial process, so you can change your mind whenever you want as long as your data is in good shape.</p>
<p>All of this stuff is brilliant when everyone uses a common set of words to describe things, but what about when they might use different ones?</p>
<p><a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/taxonomy_Page_21.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18194" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/taxonomy_Page_21.png" alt="taxonomy_Page_21" width="<blockquote><p>Categories[^1] are an emergent way of describing set creation operations based on attributes</p></blockquote>

<h2>Downsides</h2>
<p><img class="alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/stalin2.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="377" />With free-form tagging, even with cool, advanced versions with typeahead support and synonyms there are downsides.</p>
<p>If you have megalomaniac tendencies, or a god complex. free-form tagging is no good. You are ceding control to your vassals. You don't get to have total control over your taxonomy. You should be wary of this if you don't trust your staff.</p>
<p>The other downside is a bit more subtle and easier to work with. Tags and content in general needs to be gardened. This means that every so often someone needs to convert all the "HOuse" tags into "House" tags.</p>
<h1>"OK you weird nerd, why are you telling me this?"</h1>
<p>Well, mainly because I like you. I do this stuff and I might as well share what I'm thinking with people.</p>
<p>Secondly it's part of the grand project to sort out all our data, so I'm sharing my philosophy of data with you and I'd love if you could ask me questions and probe the bits that I've missed. I'm looking for any comments, as aggressive as you like, about how we can make our data capture better!</p>

[^1]: I recognise that I don't know any Category Theory and not a great deal of Set Theory. I might be committing horrible sins with this statement. It works in it's naive context though.

[^2]: one of my heroes. If he isn't one of yours then he really should be!

[^3]: I think that this is the way 

[^4]: yes the same metadata that all the fuss is about in the news
