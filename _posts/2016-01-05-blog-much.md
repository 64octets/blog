<p>While messing about with switching from Wordpress to Jekyll I found a list of posts. With a bit of sublime+R...</p>
<p><a href="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/blogFreq.png" rel="attachment wp-att-2718"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2718" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/blogFreq.png" alt="blogFreq" /></a></p>
<p>Reading over some of the posts from 2006, I was such a dick 10 years ago! Will I feel the same in 10 years time?</p>
