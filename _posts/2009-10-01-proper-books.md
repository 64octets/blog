<p>I got a bit of a telling off from Andrew when I was talking to him last week for not having any proper books on<a title="my reading list" href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/2009/09/my-reading-list/"> my list</a>. There were some, but I just forgot to put them in.</p>

<p>The Na√Øve Set Theory is from the library and is a beautiful pre 1977 version with gold blocked text on the cover, and is for the course I'm about to do (starting tomorrow night - so I'll probably post up my homework).</p>
<p>The General Systems Theory seems to be out of print, but I've got what I think it a first edition from a web bookshop.</p>
<p>They are going to make a bit of a dent in my time compared to the other pop-science that is on that list!</p>
