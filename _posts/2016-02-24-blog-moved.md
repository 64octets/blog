I warned a few weeks ago that we'd be moving, and now we have!

#The blog

The old blog was on Wordpress, and had been there [since 2006](http://notionparallax.co.uk/2006/new-website). I remember moving it over from whatever it was before (frames I think) to a self hosted Wordpress site and being pretty unimpressed by the 'famously simple' installation process. Things have changed a lot since then and I still really like Wordpress; it's got so much easier to use.

I've moved over to Jekyll and GitHub Pages because I can understand the whole process. Good enough understanding of how every part of it works. That's also combined with my growing enthusiasm for writing in Sublime and waning love of the tinyMCE editor that wordpress uses. Especially its tendency to help out by deleting large chunks of content.

##Warnings

There is a *lot* that still needs to be done. 

Irina has done a great job of the index page, and the way that has spilled over into the article pages is plenty good enough to launch. There will be style tweaking as I find things that need to be fixed.

There is no redirect setup for the old permalinks. I have a file that maps the old links to the new links, so as soon as I figure out an elegant way to do it I'll make all the old links work. In the meantime, patience.

There's no search, 404 page, or any of the other things that I can't think of right now.

If you spot anything that looks munted, leave a comment on that page and I'll fix it up. (Or you can just email me about it: <ben@notionparallax.co.uk>.)

#Me

I'm in Vancouver I've been here a week today, it's pretty great! More on that to come.
