<p>Architects seem to act in a 'us vs them' way to other architects. This is probably the case in lots of other industries, but it's not going to help drive the explosive growth that software-backed industries have seen.</p>
<p>I don't think that it's really an 'us vs them' situation. I prefer to think about it as 'us vs nature'. When there are more of us then it becomes easier to overcome nature.</p>
<p>Open source web technology has changed the way that the world works. Something like 90% of the internet is runs on Linux servers, with OS software. This culture has led to commercial companies like Twitter sharing things like their Bootstrap library. This has meant that it's trivially easy to set up a good looking website and to get your self out on the internet.</p>
<p>This hasn't cost Twitter anything, they were doing it anyway! It &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; unlocked huge amounts of value for other people. That's just a simple example, there are thousands of others out there.</p>
<p>Nothing like that exists for architecture.</p>
<p>There are a couple of companies out there that are doing open source design work [put in the examples]. I'm a huge fan of the the work that they are doing, but I don't think that the industry is ready for them. There are lower hanging fruit!</p>
<p>Architects compete on a number of dimensions. Mostly it's cost, but we'd prefer to claim that it's design quality. I'd like it to be &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; deign quality. That means that anything that we, as an industry, can do to reduce costs associated with non-design things is a Good Thing.</p>
<p>One of the things that we spend time on is admin. That's a super broad term. It could mean cleaning the office and buying paper clips, or it could mean coordinating documents. YOu can make a claim that it's possible to compete on the ability to get your admin done faster and better than the next person. That's true, but I don't want to be that guy!</p>
<p>That's why at BVN we've decided to start open sourcing some of our assets. It's going to be a slow start, but we're going to identify things that don't really give us a competitive advantage and share them.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will prompt others to do the same. Over time we can make pull requests against each other's assets and make them better. Hopefully we can make common assets out of the best bits.</p>
<p>This uses the web concept of &lt;em&gt;paving the cow paths&lt;/em&gt;. That means that standards emerge out of what people are already doing. Whilst I have a lot of respect for standards organisations, they are rarely fast enough to be meaningful. This allows people to adopt what they find useful and ignore what they don't.</p>
<p>We're going to try to open up more of our assets over time. If other practices adopt them then that's great! Hopefully it'll help them. It'll also help us if we ever work with someone who uses the same assets and protocols as it'll reduce friction at the boundary between the two organisations.</p>
<p>Check out the first thing we've opened, our style guide. Keep an eye out for more!</p>
