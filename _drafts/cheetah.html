<p>I've been mulling this idea over for some time now, but it's still poorly formed. What is the right relationship between work and idleness, calm and aggression, et cetera? The source of the idea comes from thinking about carnivores and herbivorous animals. Carnivores seem to have a lot of leisure time. Their food is dense with nutrients, so they can afford to go longer periods between eating. They use this time for idleness and development. Because of the high density of nutrients, they're able to have explosive expenditures of energy to get their next meal.</p>
<p>By contrast, herbivores seem to [actually 00:00:35]. It's also able to be explosively aggressive, charging bulls or antelopes, but those [inaudible 00:00:42] seem to fit our easy picture of their behaviour.</p>
<p>In "Day of the Triffids", one of the characters has a great quote about leisure. Without any great study, leisure seems to be well correlated with progress, whereas periods of [graph 00:00:57] feel stagnant. I may be going off on a tangent here, but it feels like the zen, the [odds most 00:01:03] cycle maintenance concept, the finding calm or peace of mind to be able to perform certain tasks is related.</p>
<p>Leisure is needed to get into the mindset of calm. Excessive business causes a mindset similar to the World War I attitudes that kept sending men over the trenches to their deaths. In this case, we're dealing with a much smaller percentage of human life, but wasting time when time is finite, is just a matter of degree. Being too busy to put the round wheels on because the square ones are okay and we have a deadline to hit, comes up far more often than I ever expected it to. The very fact that people are tired of the axe-sharpening parable shows how common it is.</p>
<p>So I've got an antelope hanging in my tree. Dinner for the next few days is sorted. Now what? There's a star there. There have been articles about outsourcing all domestic work. They feel uncomfortable but I doubt that feeling will last.</p>
<p>A star. I've balanced my sense of calm, of scentedness, of aggression. Meditation seems to be a key part of almost all of [Tim Ferriss' 00:02:12] guests. For more than I expected.</p>
<p>The cheetah has a very simple set of motivations: eat and mate. Perhaps our motivations are the same, but our methods feel more complex. The cheetah's food is our money. A medium to enable freedom. The freedom is the goal, not food or money. This feels like a preachy conclusion, and perhaps the result isn't the important part. It's more of a mindset, being idly ready, [inaudible 00:02:40] busy, or plainly lazy - it's the way to be.</p>
<p>I was going to make this into a Toastmaster speech, but it needs a bit more thought. Perhaps I could talk about cheetahs, cows and pandas and about why it's best to be an apex predator. About the importance of leisure. Turning my usual thought explosion into an imperative statement is my greatest challenge at the moment.</p>
