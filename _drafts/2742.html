<h1>ReLease ideas</h1>
<p>I tried to explain this to a friend recently. I ended up needing to keep rolling back layers, so I'll try and start at the base layer and work up. It might feel a bit abstract, but if you stick with it until the end it should make more sense. (Perhaps a chose-your-own-adventure style would be better?)</p>
<p>The first thing to explain is the way software gets to it's customers. To begin with (in the 70s) a man in a suit would come to your business. (In those days only businesses could afford software.) He'd sell you the idea of the software over a few expensive lunches. Then a bus-load of nerds would come and camp out at your HQ. They'd tailor the software to fit your system. This wasn't easy because each system was different and everyone wanted different things from the software.</p>
<p>Eventually compliers padded the gap between individual systems (hardware) and the software that ran on them. People could make software  more generically and sell it to people who--although still highly technical--weren't professional software nerds. (We're in the windows 3 era now, early 90s.) </p>
<p>Not much changed until about 2007 when chrome was first released. By now some software was downloaded and installed instead of coming on a disk, but the process was more or less the same. </p>
<p>There had been a few bits of software that had downloadable patches. They tended to have a warning that a told you that a new version was available and that you were welcome to update your system (if you felt like it)[1. By now windows was doing regular patches that applied when you restarted, and Linux <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">package management</a> was going strong, but that was on the fringes.]. Chrome was the first, really mainstream bit of software that silently updated. That meant that it was only the most tech-savvy who were behind the latest version[1. and therefore vulnerable to things going wrong.] rather than the opposite.</p>
<p>You are probably wondering why this matters in this context. I'll bring this specific idea back again later, but for now the important thing is what underlies this trend; what makes it possible!</p>
<p>We're all old enough to remember when software came in shrink wrapped boxes. A new version would come out once a year or so. This meant that the whole cadence of the producers was geared around producing these massive, monolithic releases. Waterfall planning found a perfect niche here in working out what could and couldn't be fitted into 'the next release'. Usually this left a tiny window for the parts of the process that actually generated the most value. Things like talking to customers and deep thinking about strategy lost out to designing box art, marketing and testing.</p>
<p>The former, although important, could be compressed by managers, whereas the latter had fixed time scales.</p>
<p>Delivering software via the internet meant that there wasn't a manufacturing constraint any more. But as anyone who makes things will tell you, getting a product to a customer is rarely constrained by how fast you can put it in the box.</p>
<p>Making software takes time, and there are many steps a program needs to go through before it can be given to a user.</p>
<p>Eventually the majority of software was accessed via a browser rather than installed locally on the user's computer. That made the perfect conditions for things to change. I might be applying too much hindsight here, but it seems that the key to change was the shift in mindset from delivering software to delivering value. To drag out a tired old metaphor: "[People] don't want quarter-inch bits. They want quarter-inch holes."[1. http://rites-of-passage.com/images/Levitt_TheMarketingImagination.pdf?] </p>
<p>Software people who maintained services on the internet were able to see detailed analytics on who did what, which parts of the site got used, where users abandoned their searches and so on. But releases were still expensive. It took upwards of a week to deploy a new version of the software. So they did what any sensible, regular person would do in the situation; they waited. ( Quarterly releases are still a thing in some sad old-fashioned places.)</p>
<p>Almost all the jobs that needed to be done between the programming and the release could be automated. Because this was work that could be done using the skills and raw materials that software people had, they just got on with it! That resulted in the devops revolution.</p>
<p>Now, complex, automated tooling is the norm in software. Every time you press save the work of two weeks in 1998 time gets executed. This has brought cycle times down from one year (in the boxed software days) to companies like Amazon who deploy multiple-thousands of times a day.</p>
<p>Deployment being so simple means that new kinds of things are possible. A|B tests, staged rollouts, ultra-fast response times to market forces and current events. All this stuff is allowing software to win.</p>
<p>We often talk about software as it it's a thing, or at least a sector. I think it's more productive to think of it as a <em>mindset</em>.</p>
<p>So much of software ideology comes from Japanese manufacturing philosophy. They joined it onto other ideas, scavenged pragmatically from other fields and made something close to a religion based on what works!</p>
<p>Manufacturing and software are both on board with this, but architecture and interiors got left behind. There are predictable reasons given, and some have some merit. However I see them counting in some/most contexts, not in <em>all</em>.</p>
<p>The most common is that <em>each project is unique</em>. I see this as analogous to the 1970s computer salesman and army of nerds period. Whilst each project is unique, there is far more 'the same' than different between any two. If compilers were able to iron out the difference between computer systems then we should be able to systematise-away most of the uniqueness in built projects.</p>
<p>"<em>The work I do can't be automated!</em>" I have <a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/?p=1799">written about this before</a>. Most people think that the work that they do is <em>all</em> valuable, but really the 80:20 rule[1. Pareto principle or power law.] applies (at least) and the time spent as a creative genius is far outweighed by time spent doing <a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/?p=1768">delegatable, and therefore automatable tasks</a>.</p>
<p>Software has become so powerful because it has the means to reverse that ratio. (Often talked about as leverage.)</p>
<p>"<em>Software is intangible, it takes time to do X!</em>" This argument has far more merit. If <em>X</em> is to varnish some wood or wait for concrete columns to cure then it does take time. However there <em>are</em> things that don't take time. Every day people put up ad-hoc offices in cafes and airport lounges. Tiny nodes of major corporations that are set up and torn down in seconds. This is where I think our effort should be focused!</p>
<p>Enough of the ranting and onto the specifics. I'm excited about this project because it is the first viable application of the software mindset to built space. It takes infrastructure (other people's vacant real estate) and deploys a service to it. (Workplace As A Service--is WAAS too silly?) It also has the potential to scale[1. although I don't think that scaling early is necessarily a good idea. Limiting WIP and iterating fast might be better.] and be highly instrumented.</p>
<p>Because it'd have a low deployment and teardown time it would allow for continuous improvement (CI) based on qualitative feedback from users and quantitative feedback from sensors.</p>
<p>If we can get the users accustomed to continuous improvement (CI) then they would be excited to see the new physical features included in the space. Not only physical features though.</p>
<p>I love the idea of this being like space exploration. If we take everything with us, then like NASA we have total control.</p>
<p>Tesla sets a fantastic precedent for this. They push software updates to their physical product automatically. These make a difference to how a roadster handles as well as just giving new buttons to press. We can do the same, continuous deployment of improvements to the software that makes the space work better than a regular space. That would probably start with things like really good air conditioning[1. Temperature, humidity, air flow, gas composition, not just roughly controlling the temperature.] or making a standing desk set itself to the users desired height rather than pressing the buttons. These sorts of things have been the norm in luxury cars for years, it's time they were the norm in workspaces.</p>
<p>All of this is physical, but it would also create a longitudinal relationship with the users. Allowing us to help them to redefine <em>how</em> they work. Can their workspace be more than a passive part of that? This takes us into the realms of the quantified self. Knowing what you do, and what factors {which? a|e}ffect that gives people a competitive edge. We'd become an active part of their business, not just a vessel for shelter.</p>
