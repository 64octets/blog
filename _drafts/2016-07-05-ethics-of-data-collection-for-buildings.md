title: Ethics of data collection for buildings
---

This is a topic I've thought about a lot, but know very little of the formal issues surrounding it. I had a coffee with [Rhys Goldstein](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/people/rhys-goldstein)[^1] today and he had the idea that a framework for collecting data about building occupants and their behaviour would be really valuable. It would make it possible to combine data from different environments and build up patterns across different situations. Currently there isn't a standard which means that the data can't be readily combined.

## The ethical mandate

I don't have a grounding in medical ethics, but to me the way that buildings are designed today feels a bit like the way barber-surgeons practised medicine. There is a vague understanding of the way that the system operates, an accumulated set of heuristics of what's worked and what hasn't (but no general principles to back that up)[^3]. We need to fast forward a couple of centuries and take advantage of the technology that has been made available as a spill over from other industries (sensing, wireless communication...) and develop a deeper understanding of the environment that building design is practised in.

[^3]: There's also a protectionist sense that anyone criticising the methodology must by definition be hostile and stopped.

## What I'd like to come up with

This is a two pronged problem. 

### How do we collect enough data to be able to say that we have a good understanding of a person?

People are complicated and need many dimensions to describe their lives fully[^2]. How many of those dimensions do we need to collect data on to make a _good enough_ representation of their behaviour. Is there some kind of Pareto ratio that 20% of the things we _could_ measure give us 80% of the world that we care about?

[^2]: I don't have a reference for that, but I don't think it's likely to be disputed too much.

What data do we need to collect and what format should it be in? Acknowledging that future people will want to collect more and different types of data how would they go about extending that standard? 

### How do we protect that person from undue privacy incursions

### How do we reimburse the measured person?
The person being tracked is transferring value to another party. 
Is it just that they get to live in a better world? Do we n 

## Problems
* Not all collection runs will collect all data
* Providing anonymity to users (those bing tracked) is at odds with collecting detailed data
* Collecting demographic data (e.g. ethnicity, gender, income etc.) is likely to be seen as overly intrusive, but without it there is no way to ensure diversity in the data.
* These data are of benefit to everyone, but how can it be sufficiently anonymised to protect the privacy and safety of the individuals?
