# Ethics of data collection for buildings

This is a topic I've thought about a lot, but know very little of the formal issues surrounding it. I had a coffee with [Rhys Goldstein](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/people/rhys-goldstein)[^1] today and he had the idea that a framework for collecting data about building occupants and their behaviour would be really valuable. It would make it possible to combine data from different environments and build up patterns across different situations. Currently there isn't a standard which means that the data can't be readily combined.

## What I'd like to come up with

This is a two pronged problem. 

### How do we collect enough data to be able to say that we have a good understanding of a person

### How do we protect that person from undue privacy incusrions  

## Problems
* Not all collection runs will collect all data
* Providing anonymity to users (those bing tracked) is at odds with collecting detailed data
* Collecting demographic data (e.g. ethnicity, gender, income etc.) is likely to be seen as overly intrusive, but without it there is no way to ensure diversity in the data.
* These data are of benefit to everyone, but how can it be sufficiently anonymised to protect the privacy and safety of the individuals?
