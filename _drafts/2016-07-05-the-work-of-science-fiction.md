all writing does some work. non fiction explains or documents something, fiction simulates a world that doesn't exist.
lit fix simulates relationships or events in a world that we are comfortable with, one that exists or has existed.
scifi simulates less certain things. sometimes it's people we don't recognise in a world that we do, other times it's people we recognise in worlds that we don't. occasionally it's both.
either way, there is exploration of scenarios that we haven't encountered before
