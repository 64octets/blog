# Material / movement ideas

### Shape memory alloys

![Shape memory alloy actuator folds paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/16/future_things_files/SMA_wires.gif)

These work like muscles, they change length when a current flows through them. They aren't very strong, but the idea is that you use many them in small situations. Here's a nice example of a [very simple one from MIT](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.12/people/laia.mogassoldevila/projects/p10.html). Imagine that being repeated as a module to control light or acoustic access. The best thing about them is that they have no 'moving' parts; they just change shape. That means there are no motors to fail etc. It's quite a mature technology now.

### Festo Muscles (and animals)

![a skeleton tower moved by hydraulic muscles]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/16/future_things_files/muscle_tower.gif)

This is a much more muscular muscle. The image above is of the [TU Delft research project](http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/index.php?id=16060&L=1) from about 12 years ago where they built a tower that moved about. They are strong, but not all that easy to control. 

Festo make a series of animals too, they show off what can be done with their control systems.

There are lots of example of _[soft robotics](http://www.fastcompany.com/3037993/furl-the-eeg-responsive-soft-robotics-future-of-architecture)_.

[Here's some more examples as an image search](https://www.google.ca/search?q=soft+robotics&client=ubuntu&espv=2&biw=1855&bih=971&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT5_mSo8HNAhVL6mMKHbRzDAoQ_AUIBygC)

### Other industrial control mechanisms (pneumatics and hydraulics)

Pneumatic and hydraulic control allows for almost anything to be done. There is a massive field of industrial control mechanisms. At one end there's robotic arms and quadrupeds that can do almost anything and go anywhere.

At the other there are subtle puffs of air that can sort things off conveyors

### Kites (structures with constrained inflatable parts)

Kite surfing kites are combination inflatable and tensile structures. The inflatable leading edge wants to be straight, but the wind force and cables want it to bend.

### Zorbs (Tied back) and foams

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/16/future_things_files/zorb.gif)

Zorbs are balls inside other balls, where the natural shape of the inflation is constrained by internal cables. Here's an example of that used as a room.

These people actually [sell a bunch of inflatable rooms](http://www.everychina.com/p-z52e3bf3-102620043-transparent-room-inflatable-tent-inflatable-bubble-tent-with-blower-cy-m2731.html)!

I think that these would be interesting if combined with shape memory alloys or festo muscles as the tie back cables. You may be able to pull it around as you want.

We've seen this before!

### Balanced joints

# Office ideas

### If desks are for putting paper on, are they needed? 

### Why floor mount everything? roof mounting? (power lifting rack)

### Room scale VR

### Wall scale displays with mixed pin/project

### Team coworking and amplified teams.
