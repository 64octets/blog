### Financing and insurance

In the hierarchy of influence on how a building is designed, architects currently occupy a fairly low rung. The top rung is currently occupied by insurance companies. They have the ultimate long term view of a rented asset because they are responsible for maintaining it. They are happy to spend more now for future risk mitigation.

At the other extreme, there are also distributed ownership models like [crowd funding](http://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2013/04/19/crowdfundings-latest-invasion-real-estate/#45ed2e7374f4).

### (x)aas: can amenity be made contractable?

### Flexibility: What sorts of things can be done in the space? What can't?

Are commercial towers solely for knowledge work? Is knowledge work exclusively clean, data work? What happens when you want to prototype your product or cook a meal for your team? Is that possible? What happens if you need to run a welder or a server farm?

These sorts of questions are useful when we're thinking about what we can't do in a building. We should make our assumptions clear when we are saying what you can't do, and try to make everything else possible.

Google's brief for their office was for a space that they could crane out different bits and move things around. Most architects lost the commission because they assumed that they were being metaphorical. The winning design was reconfigurable. Could you have a system that had robot movers that could move all the furniture, the walls and the floors? It's not a technology problem, that bit is solved!

### Peak IT: Architects need a lot of bandwidth for their work (synchronising models etc.), but does everyone else?

### Decreasing org size

### People want to be expressive: (don't talk about generations, it's not really meaningful - ref OKC)
